# DIY Air Purifier with Water Filtration




## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an advanced DIY air purifier with water filtration capabilities. The goal was to create a cost-effective, efficient, and user-friendly air purification system that could be monitored and controlled via a web-based interface.


#### Timeline: December 2022 â€“ April 2023

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Control with Arduino IDE:** Debugged and configured the Arduino IDE for precise, real-time control of the air purifier system.

- **Web-Based User Interface:** Designed and developed an intuitive web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for monitoring and adjusting air purifier settings.

- **Data Logging and Analysis:** Integrated data logging capabilities with Python, enabling users to track performance metrics and analyze purification efficiency.

- **Inventory Tracking System:** Designed a user interface for inventory management, ensuring seamless API integration and efficient data handling.

- **Optimized Database Handling:** Leveraged Django ORM for streamlined database operations and MySQL for optimized data storage and manipulation.

- **Test-Driven Development:** Implemented JavaScript-based tests to ensure a robust and high-quality user experience.

## Tech Stack
